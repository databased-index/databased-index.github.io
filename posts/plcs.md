### What is a PLC?

PLC, or Programmable Logic Controller, is basically a computer that has been manufactured specifically to be used in industrial environments, such as metallurgical companies, oil rigs and so on.

They essentially serve as an interface between the digital and the physical, meaning you can input a certain value in the computer, it will interpret and the machine linked to it will follow its instructions post-process.
